<h2>Variables</h2>

<li>x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the data from the downloaded files.</li>
<li>x_data, y_data and subject_data merge the previous datasets to further analysis.</li>
<li>features contains the correct names for the x_data dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in mean_and_std_features, a numeric vector used to extract the desired data.</li>
<li>A similar approach is taken with activity names through the activities variable.</li>
<li>all_data merges x_data, y_data and subject_data in a big dataset.</li>
<li>Finally, averages_data contains the relevant averages which will be later stored in a .txt file.</li>
